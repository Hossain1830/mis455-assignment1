            Dry foods can be divided into two main types:
            <ol type="i">
               <li>Dry fruits</li>
               <li>Dry cakes</li>
            </ol>
            <p><h4>Dry Fruits</h4>
              This includes snacks like nuts,raisins, dried apricots, and figs. They are nutritious and provide
              natural sugars, fiber, and vitamins, making them a great choice for a quick energy boost.
            </p>
            <p><h4>Dry Cakes</h4> 
              Examples are pound cake and fruitcake, which are less moist. They make convenient
              snacks or desserts and are easy to store. Both types offer tasty options for snacking or
              enjoying with meals, catering to different tastes.

            Dry fruits are healthy snacks packed with vitamins, minerals, and fiber, making them a great source of quick
            energy. They are best enjoyed between meals, as they can help curb cravings without fatal digestion.
            However, because they are calorie-dense, it is important to eat them in moderation; about a small handful per day.
            Some varieties may have added sugars, so it's wise to check labels for healthier options.

            While dry fruits offer many benefits, consuming too many can lead to weight gain or spikes in blood sugar due to
            their concentrated sugars. The ideal time to enjoy dry fruits is as a snack, especially when paired with nuts for a
            balanced boost of protein and healthy fats. Always store them properly to keep them fresh.

            Dry cakes, like pound cake and fruitcake, are convenient snacks that can be enjoyed anytime. They are firmer and
            less moist than regular cakes, making them easy to store and transport. While they can be tasty and satisfying, itâ€™s
            important to enjoy them in moderation, as they often contain added sugars and fats, which can contribute to
            weight gain if consumed excessively.
        </p>
        <p>
            The best time to enjoy dry cakes is as an occasional treat or dessert, especially with a cup of tea or coffee. Pairing
            them with fruit or yogurt can enhance their nutritional value. While they can be a fun addition to your diet, be  
            mindful of portion sizes to maintain a balanced diet and avoid overindulgence. Always check the ingredient list for
            healthier options without too many additives or preservatives.
