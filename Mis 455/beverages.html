            Cold drinks like Coca-Cola, Pepsi, Mojo, and Sprite are carbonated beverages known for their refreshing taste
            and effervescence, often enjoyed on hot days or during social gatherings. They come in various flavors and are
            typically sweetened with sugar or artificial sweeteners. On the other hand, fruit juices, like orange, apple, or 
            grape juice, are non-carbonated, providing a natural sweetness and a rich source of vitamins. Both types of 
            beverages offer unique flavors and experiences, catering to different preferences.

            Carbonated drinks, like soda, can be tasty but often have a lot of sugar, which is not great for your health. Drinking them
            too much can lead to weight gain, diabetes, and dental problems. It is usually better to enjoy these drinks with or
            after meals to avoid feeling bloated. Moderation is important; try to have them only sometimes instead of every day.
            Choosing low-sugar or sugar-free options can also help. Always check the labels for sugar content to make healthier choices.

            Non-carbonated beverages like fruit juice can be a healthy choice, as they often provide vitamins and nutrients,
            especially when made from 100% fruit. However, they can also be high in natural sugars, so moderation is important.
            It is generally better to drink fruit juice with meals, as this can help with digestion and balance blood sugar levels.  
            Limiting intake to a small glass a day can help avoid excessive sugar consumption. Choosing whole fruits over juice can be even
            healthier, as they contain fiber. Always check labels to ensure you're getting pure juice without added sugars or preservatives.
